/**
 * Consolidation — engram's "dreaming" layer (Phase 3).
 *
 * Memory can't grow without bound and stay sharp. Like a sleeping brain, engram
 * periodically replays the day, scores each memory's *salience*, and decides
 * what to keep hot and what to let fade. The model is value-based forgetting,
 * not LRU: a memory survives on a blend of recency, how often it's been
 * retrieved, and its importance — so an old-but-important lesson outlives a
 * fresh-but-trivial note.
 *
 * Forgetting here is reversible: low-salience memories are *cold-archived*
 * (excluded from recall), never hard-deleted, and re-admitted the moment
 * they're hit again. Protected tiers (semantic/procedural lessons) are never
 * archived. A dream pass also strengthens the edges between memories that were
 * recently used together (Hebbian: cells that fire together, wire together).
